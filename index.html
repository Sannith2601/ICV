        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this project, we aim to develop a computer vision system to count cars in a parking lot. This system can provide valuable information for parking lot owners, city planners, and transportation authorities. By analyzing car counts over time, we can optimize parking lot utilization, improve traffic flow, and enhance overall urban mobility.</p>

    <!-- Method Section -->
    <section id="method">
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>Our approach involves using a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm called YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect cars in parking lot images. YOLO is known for its real-time performance and accuracy in detecting objects in images.</p>
        <p>We begin by preprocessing the images and then pass them through the YOLO model. After obtaining the bounding boxes for detected cars, we count the number of cars present in each image. This count is then aggregated over multiple images to analyze car counts over time.</p>

        <h2>Analysis of Results</h2>
        <!-- Include analysis of results here -->
        <p>Analyzing car counts over a large set of images reveals interesting patterns and insights. By plotting the number of cars against time, we can observe:

           <p>Peak hours: We observe peaks in car counts during specific hours of the day, indicating peak parking lot usage. This information can help parking lot operators optimize staffing and resources during busy periods.<p>
           <p>usage trends: Analyzing trends over days or weeks can reveal usage patterns such as weekday vs. weekend usage, seasonal variations, and special event impacts.</p>

    <section id="vision-algorithms">
        <h2>Analysis of Vision Algorithms</h2>
        <!-- Include analysis of vision algorithms here -->
        <p>Our experience with YOLO highlights the importance of robust vision algorithms for accurate car counting. We found that:

<p>Model Tuning: Fine-tuning the YOLO model on parking lot images improves detection accuracy, especially in challenging conditions such as low light or occlusions.<p>
<p>Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques such as image normalization and augmentation can enhance model performance by reducing noise and improving generalization.<p>
<p>Real-time Processing: YOLO's real-time processing capability allows for efficient analysis of large image datasets, making it suitable for applications requiring timely insights.<p>
By understanding the strengths and limitations of vision algorithms like YOLO, we can develop effective computer vision systems for diverse applications, including parking lot management.
